The need of a new way to communicate between two points of the planet has been arising as a problem
to be solved by our new media distributors. Old systems such as Skype or traditional video calls are not able
to cope the needs of the new generations of developers and users that everyday require a more integrated way of 
communication. 

Besides this, the amount of data being transferred during the last years and the prevision for the future allocates a new
scenario where non-centralized systems such as P2P are required as data bandwidth grows and systems need to become
more scalable. 

Joining both reasons lead to a whole new framework for real-time-communication (RTC) called WebRTC. This API implementation
build by multiple manufacturers in the area of communications is part of the Html5 standardization proposal.


Introduction to WebRTC.
Maybe also other stuff \cite{singh2009rate}.

Could be good to start wrtitting the introduction baselines.
